This is the code folder for the Term project from Jurrian van de Kraats, Loredana Gliga & Sander Rustenburg 

Due to size limitations does this folder not contain any TIF files. Most can be created through the code. Some TIF files were used to create RGB images in 
qgis. These cannot be extracted with the code given, hence that qgis will provide an error message. A small script was written to download a green, red and blue band to create an RGB image. However, these data are not necessary to repeat the analysis. The NDSI/NDWI/NDGI train/validation layer can 
suffice as a reference background.
